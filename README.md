## sample-terraform-registry
At attempt at creating a static TF registry using Github pages.

Thanks to https://github.com/caramelomartins/rekisteri for doing a lot of the heavy lifting and research.

You should be able to use the main.tf and `terraform init` to see this repo in action.

### Notes
- I use front matter to set the permalink for the discovery document
- I'd love to be able to use the bigger metadata files and extract necessary pieces from there so everything is in several bigger document.
  - A clever use of categories and permalinks in the _config_ may allow Liquid to take care of the paths but will need to experiment.
